# Catproof 
Petproof your Mac. Click CTRL three times to toggle the mouse and keyboard on/off temporarily.

Installation:

1. Drag the application Catproof.app to the Applications folder.
2. Go to System Preferences -> Security & Privacy -> Privacy -> Accessibility and add the app to the list. If you don't do this, the app won't be allowed to turn off your keyboard.
3. Start the app! The app will show as a cat icon in the top right corner, and will start automatically at login.

The app is open source. Please feel free to modify it and use it and do whatever you want with it, no attribution necessary.

Note that the top row of keys can't be turned off (the volume, power button, etc). If you find a way to do it, let me know!
